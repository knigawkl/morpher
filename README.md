# morpher

**1. Quantitaive analysis**

1.1 Check presence/absence of x affixes in 3 texts by single author. 

The more we automate this process, the better we scale.

1.2 Establish statistics (frequent affixes, infrequent affixes, absent affixes)

frequent = we have at least x occurnces of a given affix
infrequent = we have the affix y times, where y < x
absent = affixes do exist in our db but are not present in the text

1.3 Normalized frequencies

Number of affixes per 1000 words

1.4 Compare stat results

1.5 Present stat facts

1.6 Present tendencies (overuse, use, underuse of certain affixes)

**2. Qualitative analysis**

MCW (morphologically complex word) is:
a) base + affix 
b) built from 2+ words, having different meaning 

2.1 Lists of MCWs
 
2.2 Lists of neologisms 

Neologism can be defined as non-present word in any known vocabulary

2.3 Compare lists of overlaps and non-overlaps of particular word types

We compare MCWs and neologisms across books

2.4 Collocational analysis
2.5 Special cases, unpredictable effects
